Hello , 

In this project I wanted to replicate the Pong game because I want to learn c# development for future experience
I didnt use any sprites or anything complicated.
This project is only for me to learn basics of c# game development. 

Ive tried to make an executable file which I did but I dont know how to upload it to github properly so in order to run the game download the source code
and run it from there
